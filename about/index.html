  <h1>About Massimo Pinto</h1>
<p>
I graduated in Physics at the University of Naples <a href="http://www.unina.it">Federico II</a> in 1998 and moved on to obtain a Ph.D. in 2002 in Oncology/Physics from <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>, jointly with the Gray Cancer Institute, now part of Oxford University, but an independent instituion at the time, in Northwood, Middlesex. At the 'Gray Lab', as it was known informally, I worked in the Cell and Molecular Biophysics Group directed by Professor Barry D. Michael, under the guidance of Dr Kevin M. Prise. My Ph.D. thesis was in the characterization and quantification of DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation of varying quality. </p>
<p>
After a brief return to hometown Naples, I moved overseas again in 2003 and worked on my firt post-doctoral research fellowship in the Radiation Research division of the Radiology Department, New Jersey Medical School, directed by Professor Roger W. Howell, now merged into <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a>. By this time, I had made my first move toward the radiobiology of low doses of ionizing radiation, and my main interest was in the <em>bystander effect</em> and its interplay with the <em>adaptive response</em>. By the end of 2006, I was back to Italy for my second post-doc, in the Radiation Biophysics Group at <a href="http://www.iss.it">Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†</a>, Rome, directed by Dr. Mauro Belli. Here I worked on other radiobiological aspects that were relevant at low doses of ionizing radiation, namely the <em>adaptive response</em>.</p>
<p>
In the 2010 I obtained a permanent research position at the Italian National Institue for Metrology of Ionizing Radiation, <a href="http://www.inmri.enea.it">ENEA-INMRI</a>. I work in the Dosimetry division, where I am responsible for the Primary Standards of <em>air kerma</em>. Over the past few years, I was first trained on free air chambers and the primary measurements of air kerma that can be obtained usin them. Gradually I moved on Monte Carlo techniques, using the particle transport code PENELOPE from the University of Barcelona.  More recently, since 2014, I began working on calorimeters to obtain primary measurements of another physical quantity of relevance in radiation dosimetry, namely the <em>absorbed dose to water</em>, D<sub>W</sub>. </p>
