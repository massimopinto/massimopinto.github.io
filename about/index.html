I graduated in Physics at the University of Naples *Federico II* in 1998 and moved on to obtain a Ph.D. from [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk), jointly with the Gray Cancer Institute, now part of Oxford University, but an independent instituion at the time, in Northwood, Middlesex. At the "Gray Lab", as it was known informally, I worked in the Cell and Molecular Biophysics Group directed by Professor Barry D. Michael, under the guidance of Dr Kevin M. Prise. 
After a brief return to hometown Naples, I moved overseas again in 2003 and worked on my firt post-doctoral research fellowship in the Radiation Research division of the Radiology Department, New Jersey Medical School, directed by Professor Roger W. Howell, now merged into Rutgers University. By this time, I had made my first move toward the radiobiology of low radiation doses. By the end of 2006, I was back to Italy for my second post-doc, in the Radiation Biophysics Group at Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, Rome, directed by Dr. Mauro Belli. Here I worked on other radiobiological aspects that were relevant at low doses of ionizing radiation.
In the 2010 I obtained a permanent research position at the Italian National Institue for Metrology of Ionizing Radiation (ENEA-INMRI). I work in the Dosimetry division, where I am responsible for the primary standards of air kerma.
