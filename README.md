I am getting my hands on GitHub Pages thanks to the advice of [Caterina Visco](http://catevisco.github.io) and the remote guidance of [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com).
To do:
1. Get to understand Jekyll functions and verify its installation on your computer
2. Get to understand how to incorporate images in any pages, beginning from the home page with a photo
3. Migrate the blog archive from Galileo.net. The markup pages used to be textile, and the blog archive has been exported into a MySql database. If in doubt, ask Emanuele.
