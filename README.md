I am getting my hands on GitHub Pages thanks to the advice of [Caterina Visco](http://catevisco.github.io) and the remote guidance of [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com).

To do:

1. Update CV to incorporate non-work, education related info.
2. try to make LaTeX and BiBTeX integration possible, and import all publications into a dedicated section.
3. Galileo Blog: re-import with jekyll-import using the jekyll-textile-converter to incorporate tags-categories. Update index page to choose posts from categories.
4. Galileo Blog: correct the footer of individual posts to remind the reader that each single post was once published on the [Galileo](http://www.galileonet.it) platform.
5. Make sure that the CC license you have specified is the correct one.

Done:

1. Get to understand Jekyll functions and verify its installation on your computer.
2. Get to understand how to incorporate images in any pages, beginning from the home page with a photo
3. Migrate the blog archive from Galileo.net. The markup pages used to be textile, and the blog archive has been exported into a MySql database. If in doubt, ask Emanuele.
4. Up-took icons via Font Awesome.
