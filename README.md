I am getting my hands on GitHub Pages thanks to the advice of [Caterina Visco](http://catevisco.github.io) and the remote guidance of [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com). 
To do: 
1. Get to understand Jekyll functions and verify its installation on your computer
2. Get to understant how to incorporate images in pages
3. Migrate the blog archive from Galileo.net
