	<p class="lead">Hi, my name is <span itemprop="name">Massimo Pinto</span> and I am a research scientist working in the field of radiation dosimetry</p>
	<p>I am an experimental <span itemprop="title">physicist</span> living in <span itemprop="address" itemscope
    itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address"> <span itemprop="locality">Rome</span>, <span itemprop="region">Italy</span></span>, and I work at the  <span itemprop="affiliation"> <a href="http://www.inmri.enea.it">Italian National Institute of Ionizing Radiation Metrology</a></span>.</p>
		<p>I am also a supporter of <a href="https://strava.com/athletes/3800623"> cycling</a>, be this for commuting, traveling, or for going around with friends on a mountain bike in the woods that surround the <span itemprop="locality">Rome</span> region. I am a regular listener of (national public) radio programmes, which is making me feel like I belong to another era, sometimes.</p>
		<p>And I am curious about the web and the publication opportunities that it provides. I have been a podcaster for several years, and a blogger for many more, publishing on free blogs such as <a href="https://fisiciaroundtheworld.wordpress.com">Fisici per il mondo</a> or hosted on the Italian science magazine <a href="http://www.galileonet.it">Galileo</a>  (now reproduced <a href="/blog">here</a>), or on the <em>Nature Network</em>, with <em>Science in the Belpaese</em>. In fact, blogging and podcasting landed me on the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html">Nature</a> Journal a couple of times.</p>
