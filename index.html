	<p class="lead">Hi, my name is <span itemprop="name">Massimo Pinto</span> and I am a research scientist working in the field of radiation dosimetry.</p>
	<p>I see myself as an experimental <span itemprop="title">physicist</span>, but nowadays even experimental physics won't go too far unless one does some Monte Carlo simulations, and I am accordingly a sort of a <em>chimera</em> between a <span itemprop="title">programmer</span> and a <span itemprop="title">code user</span>. I live in <span itemprop="address" itemscope
    itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address"> <span itemprop="locality">Rome</span>, <span itemprop="region">Italy</span></span> and I work at the  <span itemprop="affiliation">the <a href="http://www.inmri.enea.it">Italian National Institute for Metrology of Ionizing Radiation</a></span>.</p>
		<p>I am also very much into leisure cycling, be this for commuting or for going around with friends on a mountain bike in the many woods that surround the <span itemprop="locality">Rome</span> region. I am a regular listener of (national public) radio programmes, which is making me feel like I belong to another era, sometimes.</p>
		<p>And I am curious about the web and the publication opportunities that it provides. I have been a podcaster for several years, and a blogger for many more, publishing on free blogs such as <a href="https://fisiciaroundtheworld.wordpress.com">Fisici per il mondo</a> or hosted on the Italian science magazine <a href="http://www.galileonet.it">Galileo</a>. In fact, blogging and podcasting landed my on <em>Nature</em> a couple of times, while this hasn't happened for my research yet 8-).</p>
