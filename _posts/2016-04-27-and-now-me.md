Well. Finally got around to putting this sort of blog together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. And I think I really should thank Hank Quinlan for making it so very easy.
