This is not exactly original and, in fact, serves as a template to operate with.
Finally got around to putting this sort of blog together.

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. My blog contribution is actually elsewhere, on [Fisici Around the World](http://fisiciaroundtheworld.wordpress.com) but I am going use these pages for daily annotations, as well as to recover my old blogging work on the Science Magazine [Galileo](http://www.galileonet.it). For this, I'll need to apply some filter and import from my old database. I shall definitely give it a try.

And I think I really should thank [Hank Quinlan](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for making it so very easy.
