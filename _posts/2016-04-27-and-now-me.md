Well. Finally got around to putting this sort of blog together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. My blog contribution is actually elsewhere, on [Fisici Around the World](http://fisiciaroundtheworld.wordpress.com) but I am going use these pages for daily annotations, as well as to recover my old blogging work on the Science Magazine [Galileo](http://www.galileonet.it). 

And I think I really should thank Hank Quinlan for making it so very easy.
