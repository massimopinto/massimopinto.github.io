This is not exactly original and, in fact, serves as a template to operate with.

This - blogging platform is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. If used in conjunction with the Atom text editor, for example, this gets even easier.
My blog contribution is actually elsewhere, on [Fisici Around the World](http://fisiciaroundtheworld.wordpress.com) but I am going use these pages for daily annotations, as well as to recover my old blogging work on the Science Magazine [Galileo](http://www.galileonet.it). For this, I'll need to apply some filter and import from my old database. I shall definitely give it a try. And these will all go to [PostDOC](/postDOC).

And I think I really should thank [John McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for making it so very easy, and to the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) documentation pages, so very nicely done.
